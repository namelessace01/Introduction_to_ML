## ðŸ§° Repository Overview

This repository covers a range of essential topics in ML, from understanding key libraries to building simple models. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what each section entails:

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Understanding and handling missing values, scaling data, and encoding categorical variables.
   - Practical steps to clean and prepare your data for model training.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducting visualizations and statistical summaries to gain insights into your dataset.
   - Using libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create informative plots.

- **Building Basic Models**:
   - Introduction to supervised learning models such as Linear Regression and Decision Trees.
   - Code implementations with detailed comments for each algorithm.
   - Evaluation of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

- **Feature Engineering**:
   - Techniques to transform data for improved model performance.
   - Examples include feature scaling, one-hot encoding, and polynomial features.

- **Model Evaluation**:
   - Steps to validate models using cross-validation.
   - Comparison of different algorithms to select the most suitable model.
